Cindy was here
You Are My Sunshine
By Norman Blake

Sunshine, you may find my window
But you won't find me
And sunshine, I've got my friend of darkness here
Tonight to hide me.

So sunshine, as far as I'm concerned
I'm where I want to be
And sunshine, as far as you're concerned
Don't be concerned for me.

Cause she doesn't love me anymore
She doesn't want me, Lord
She doesn't need me anymore
She grew tired of chasing rainbows
But I loved her true
And God you know I tried.

And I guess she was right
Cause I'm at the end
I found the part but there's no golden sun.

So sunshine, can't you see I'm not alone
Don't bother me
And sunshine, pick up your dawn
And move on down the street.
